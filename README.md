### Usage
Hereâ€™s how to use the Autocomplete class with a simple suggestion provider:

``` Js
import { Autocomplete } from 'nicanor-autocomplete';

// Example suggestion provider function for sentences and words
const suggestionProvider = async (input: string): Promise<string[]> => {
  const suggestions = [
    'The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.',
    'The early bird catches the worm.',
    'A picture is worth a thousand words.',
    'Actions speak louder than words.',
    'A journey of a thousand miles begins with a single step.',
    'To be or not to be, that is the question.',
    'All that glitters is not gold.',
    'Fortune favors the bold.',
    'Honesty is the best policy.',
    'Time is money.',
    'apricot', 'avocado', 'blueberry', 'blackberry', 'cranberry', 'fellow',
    'The quick brown faster bear.'
  ];

  const lowerInput = input.toLowerCase();

  const startsWithSuggestions = suggestions.filter(suggestion =>
    suggestion.toLowerCase().startsWith(lowerInput)
  );

  const includesSuggestions = suggestions.filter(suggestion =>
    suggestion.toLowerCase().includes(lowerInput) && !startsWithSuggestions.includes(suggestion)
  );

  return [...startsWithSuggestions, ...includesSuggestions];
};

const inputElement = document.getElementById('search-input') as HTMLInputElement;
new Autocomplete(inputElement, suggestionProvider);
```

With Icons and Custom CSS
You can also add optional icons to the left and/or right of each suggestion and supply your own CSS for customization:

``` Js
import { Autocomplete } from 'nicanor-autocomplete';

// Example suggestion provider function for sentences and words
const suggestionProvider = async (input: string): Promise<string[]> => {
  const suggestions = [
    'The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.',
    'The early bird catches the worm.',
    'A picture is worth a thousand words.',
    'Actions speak louder than words.',
    'A journey of a thousand miles begins with a single step.',
    'To be or not to be, that is the question.',
    'All that glitters is not gold.',
    'Fortune favors the bold.',
    'Honesty is the best policy.',
    'Time is money.',
    'apricot', 'avocado', 'blueberry', 'blackberry', 'cranberry', 'fellow',
    'The quick brown faster bear.'
  ];

  const lowerInput = input.toLowerCase();

  const startsWithSuggestions = suggestions.filter(suggestion =>
    suggestion.toLowerCase().startsWith(lowerInput)
  );

  const includesSuggestions = suggestions.filter(suggestion =>
    suggestion.toLowerCase().includes(lowerInput) && !startsWithSuggestions.includes(suggestion)
  );

  return [...startsWithSuggestions, ...includesSuggestions];
};

const inputElement = document.getElementById('search-input') as HTMLInputElement;
new Autocomplete(inputElement, suggestionProvider, {
  leftIcon: 'path/to/left-icon.png',
  rightIcon: 'path/to/right-icon.png',
  customCSS: `
    .autocomplete-suggestion {
      background-color: #f9f9f9;
    }
    .autocomplete-suggestion:hover {
      background-color: #e0e0e0;
    }
  `
});
```
